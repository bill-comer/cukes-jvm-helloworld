The src & test code here is taken directly from https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-jvm

What I wanted to do here is create it as a standalone java project without using maven so I had full control & could see what I needed.

Included in here is the .classpath & .project files for eclipse.

I am currently using STS 2.9 variant of eclipse

The jars are pulled in using ivy which I prefer over maven.
